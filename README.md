Noughts and crosses using the board module

This is a proof-of-concept implementation of the game Noughts-and-Crosses
using the board module. It'll use text rather than graphics as it's more
about the algorithms and structures than about the display.

Although the must-have implementation is a 3x3 board, in principle the ideas
should translate effectively to any 2-dimensional board, or even a 3-dimensional
one.
